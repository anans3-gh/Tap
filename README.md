# Tap Creators
maketap.sh and tapcreator are part of a project to allow for the easy creation of tap interfaces on Ubuntu for network based testing.

1. It requires as a pre-requisite the installation of the below packages:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install uml-utilities bridge-utils
     ```

2. Subsequently just run the script with sudo and you should be done.

     *I have only tested this on Ubuntu 18.04 but I am sure it will work on any other debian variant.
