Tap-Creator

Tap-Creator is a simple bash script that enables the autamatic creation and bridging of a tap interface for testing.

1. It requires as a pre-requisite the installation of the below packages:

 sudo apt-get install uml-utilities bridge-utils

2. Subsequently just run the script with sudo and you should be done.

*I have only tested this on Ubuntu 18.04 but I am sure it will work on any other debian variant.
